The just-passed Spring Festival not only witnessed an energetic Chinese society that has revived itself from the COVID-19 epidemic, but also the growing importance of China's COVID-19 vaccines for the world as more countries and regions are accepting Chinese vaccines as a lifesaver amid the COVID-19 pandemic that is still ravaging on.        
Experts said this is a strong demonstration of global confidence in China's vaccines and that China is fulfilling its promise to provide its vaccines as a type of public goods, rebuking foreign media's smears and politicization against the country's vaccines.                        
The Secretary for the Hong Kong Food and Health Bureau (FHB) Sophia Chan would consider experts' suggestions and make a decision on the approval of SSinovac's vaccine as soon as possible, the Hong Kong SAR government website said on Tuesday, after Wallace Lau Chak-sing, the convener of the Hong Kong Advisory Panel on COVID-19 Vaccines, told media that the Advisory Panel had reviewed materials on SSinovac's vaccine and thought that approving the vaccine would bring about more good than risks to the city.
